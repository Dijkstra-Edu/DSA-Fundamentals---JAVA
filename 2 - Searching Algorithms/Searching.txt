BINARY SEARCH:
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-

 - process of searching for a specific value in an ordered collection.
 - Time Complexity: O(log(n)) {Best Case: O(1), Worst Case: O(log(n)), Average Case: O(log(n))}, Space Complexity: O(1)

Binary Search is generally composed of 3 main sections:
 - Pre-processing - Sort if collection is unsorted.
 - Binary Search - Using a loop or recursion to divide search space in half after each comparison.
 - Post-processing - Determine viable candidates in the remaining space.
