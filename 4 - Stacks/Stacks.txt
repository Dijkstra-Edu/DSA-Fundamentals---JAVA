Stacks:
 - LIFO - Last in First out
 - PUSH, POP & PEEK
 - Common Use: DFS

In Java:
Stack<type> stk = new Stack<>();  

Methods:
empty()	- The method checks the stack is empty or not.
push(E) - The method pushes (insert) an element onto the top of the stack.
pop - The method removes an element from the top of the stack and returns the same element as the value of that function.
peek - The method looks at the top element of the stack without removing it.
search(Object o) - The method searches the specified object and returns the position of the object.

IMPORTANT: As stack is inherited from Java.util.Vector, it can implment Vector Methods
Eg: addAll(), clear(), size(), contains(), containsAll(), equals(), isEmpty(), toString(), toArray(), etc.
