- Only works on DAG - Directed Acyclic Graphs
- Provides a linear ordering of vertices such that if there is an edge between 
u & v, u will appear before v in the final linear order that topo sort will
produce.
 - Perfrom DFS at each node while checking if visited or not. Place in Stack. 
Finally, pop stack to get topological ordering of graph.
 - Every DAG will have atleast 1 Topo ordering
